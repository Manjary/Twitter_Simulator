For this project in distributed system, I have created a twitter engine and a client test/simulator which has functionalities
such as the ability to create multiple clients, send tweets from various clients, use of hashtag in tweets
for easy collection and storing of data related to a particular topic, use of mentions in tweets in order to
specify a certain user. A user can subscribe to other users by using the ‘subscribe’ option. This will
allow users to get tweets directly from the subscribed user who he/she is following. Our Twitter engine
supports ‘retweeting’ so as to allow sharing of interesting tweets. A user can also search for previous
tweets by using the ‘QuerySimulator’ in our program. This will retrieve tweets from the data store of
the engine and display the required tweets to the user querying the system. The query is also delivered
to the client if the client process is alive.
